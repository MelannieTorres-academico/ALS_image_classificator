# ALS_image_classificator
Using ML and a Kaggle dataset identifies the ALS letter in the given image

## Requirements
- Keras
- Tensorflow

## Dataset
The dataset couldn't be uploaded to github due to memory limitations, but the original dataset is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet)
and a smaller version ready for Keras is found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dIzMIkZXv5yhWYn2WqOozmr4GwVS5h-T?usp=sharing).


## How to run
To train run python file_name.py, be sure to check the dataset path.

To test send the model name without the extension: python run_tests.py model5


## About the process
If you want to know more about how this project was done, you can find the report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15zApA0yXexQvZGrzjFvNIJi6NfDqJ9VHA6n2iVjL-KU/edit?usp=sharing).


## Models
The models were too heavy to be uploaded here, so you can find them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nDEKKnlEsy_1SEfa9ow-ZBvTh0buk0Df?usp=sharing). If you train the model a new model will be generated.
